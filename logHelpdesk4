Problem DescriptionHello,

I have applied for a change of address (from Delhi to Bangalore) for my FSSAI registration number 23319006001865, via the application reference number 30211204109278069 on 04 Dec 2021.
I received an update on 21 Dec as per below mail and the Authority remarks are "pl upload trade lic copy".

I am neither a trader nor do I have a license. I only have a FSSAI registration mentioned above, which I had applied when I was residing in Delhi, and now that I have shifted to Bangalore permanently, I have applied for a change of address along with the address proof.

Since I do not understand how I need to respond to the Authority remarks, and having known my requirements, please advise how should I proceed.

Regards,
Prathiba

I am writing in regards to my application reference number 30211202109259323, whereby I had applied for the registration of my business under Vasudevoils. However today I had a visit of officials from your department and I was told that I need to apply for a license, not registration.

Therefore, could you please cancel my request for registration and refund the money paid towards the registration application.

I will make another application for the correct license.

Many thanks for your understanding.

Kind regards
Deepak Sharma.

Problem DescriptionI have submitted the modification application with the Fssai for a licence no 11516009000179 and bearing the application reference no. 20211026102922768 however the same was reverted back to me around 15 days back with the following reasons.
“Please submit the following documents 1. Self-declaration of proprietorship Also Technically qualified person in charge of the operations does not possess the minimum required qualification as per conditions of license: Condition No. 4. Please make necessary changes”
However when I tried to edit the application for changing the information of the technically qualified person I am unable to do so. The editing option is not functional and I can’t edit the information. I urgently need help in the same as there are only 15 days to reply to the reverted application. Please look into the matter and help me solve it.

We are facing a lot of challenges in modifying the license as per FOSCOS, our rest of licenses have been done, only this is pending. 

Challenges: 
From our Head Office FSSAI Central License the details of the manufacturer(s) are missing from KOB - "General Manufacturing > Relabeller". (Screenshot is attached for your action)
Laboratory "NO" option is frozen, since the license is for the Head Office we do not have lab. Our lab is in our factory premises. 

The Screenshot of the relevant error is attached herewith.

Problem DescriptionSir, 

We have wrongly filed non form C application ref. no. 10210920102816492 instead of form C for modification License due to addition Food Products Standards. Now I would like modify the application in Form C. While opening the modification window it is shown as two options for selection with check box. Option 1). Company Name/ Address (within Same district)/ Kind of business, Production Capacity etc. with modification fees as Rs.1000/- + differential fees, if any and Option 2). Communication details/supporting document (Non-form C modification without out fees).

I would like to change the Product List Category in to standard product which was earlier under Proprietary Food.  Shall I proceed with Option 1 with fees.

Problem DescriptionHi Ranjeet & Team,

Hope this email finds you well. Please can you process this address change request on priority. As we are down with no business as this is a cloud kitchen so bearing loss each day.
I would really appreciate if you please issue a license certificate to the new address in order to start the business.
I have attached water bill which is available at this address.
Please let me know if anything else is needed.

Problem DescriptionDear Sir/Mam,

Good Evening! Trust you doing well. 

I tried finding the option for surrender under Surrender/Transfer but was unable to do so and it was only giving me an option to surrender. The current license is in the name of my sister Lovely Sharma and as she has some personal commitments at he end she wants to transfer the license on my name Tony Sharma who is currently managing the entire set up. Please advise how can we go ahead with the transferring of the license and what are the documentation required. Request you to please give step by step guidance so we can get this done at the earliest possible.

Looking forward to hear from you to get this done.

Thanks in Anticipation and appreciate your co-operation.

Best Regards,
Tony Sharma

Kindly update us about this status as we are unaware of this sort of process during the change in address, as usually the department doesn't take this long for updating the registration.
Further, you are requested to issue the updated registration at your earliest possible.

Problem DescriptionHi Team,

I am continuously following up with your team since 15-11-2021 for changing of kind of business in my license. Today one of the helpline candidate told me to raise a request on portal.

But from helpline number(1800112100) candidates are giving same kind of answer every time. They are saying sir your license will expire on 27-12-2021 and then you can raise another license after that with change of modification. Now they are saying first renewal your license with late fee and fill modification form.

Kindly let me know while our firm is not doing business in catring due to covid then why I will go for renewal of license again. I need to just change kind of business in my license and apply for this.
And one more thing it's showing 6000 RS as a penalty which is equal to the license fee of three years. Please surrender my this license then I need to apply for new license with different nature of business (As we are planning to apply for Atta & Masala packing related works).

Penalty fee is not our fault. Due to improper knowledge of your helpline candidates such things are happening. Kindly resolve my this issue as soon as possible. Mean while my current license will be considered as surrender as I am not doing any business(catering, Restaurant) in such nature and you can also check my GST track as all are filed as a nil.

Please find attached license for your reference.

Thanks & Regards
